I faced a lot of challenges during this task to be honest, so Im not so proud of the end pruduct but I do fill like I tried my best. The biggest challenge I faced was the responsivness of the website and trying to find where I need to change thing. I learnt that one html file can inculde many css files, and how to include Javascript in to the website. And the bigggest lesson I learned is so to read the task fully and understand the requirements, what could have saved me a lot of time.
